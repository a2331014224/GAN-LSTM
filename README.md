# GAN-LSTM
Protein-secondary-structure-prediction-based-on-GAN-and-LSTM
This project is based on GaN and LSTM to predict protein secondary structure

1. Operating environment

python = 3.6

tensorflow = 2.2

keras = 2.3.1

matlab = 2018b

2. The document contains the code for building Gan and LSTM, which are put in separate folder.

3. The project contains necessary data sets, but no more detailed processing is done, such as the format transformation from '. Mat' to '. NPY'.
